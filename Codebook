The dataset contains variables like activity,mean-tBodyAcc-mean-X,mean-tBodyAcc-mean-y, mean-tBodyAcc-mean-Z, subject,etc.
30 individuals participated in the experiment. Participants performed various activities like Walking, Walking Upstairs/Downstairs,Sitting,Standing wearning a smartphone.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
